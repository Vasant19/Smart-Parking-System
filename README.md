# Smart-Parking-System
Objective-
The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly and adaptable system that can be implemented in large, multi-level parking garages in order to alleviate parking hassles. The ultimate goal is that the ideas and planning demonstrated through this system can then be easily upgraded to an actual parking facility. The purpose of the Development of Smart Parking System is to eliminate the unnecessary frustration drivers experience as they waste priceless minutes circling parking garages looking for the optimal parking spot. In addition, traffic flow within the garage will be better regulated, creating a safer atmosphere for both drivers and pedestrians.
