## Project Overview

The Smart Parking System is a user-friendly and adaptable solution designed for large, multi-level parking garages to alleviate parking hassles. This project aims to eliminate the frustration drivers experience while searching for parking spots, improve traffic flow within garages, and create a safer atmosphere for both drivers and pedestrians.
